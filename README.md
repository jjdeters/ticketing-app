Project Overview (for Copilot)
You're helping me develop a Streamlit-based ticketing system called ticket_app.py. The app includes:

A form to create tickets with fields: title, category, due date, description

Editable ticket list using st.data_editor() so I can modify any ticket inline

Data persistence using a tickets.json file (local storage)

Filtering options in the sidebar:

Show/hide resolved tickets

Filter by category or keyword (searches title and description)

Optional sorting by due date

I want to keep it as a simple self-contained Streamlit app (no backend database or hosting yet), but I may eventually want to:

Add user login or password protection

Improve the layout and UX

Add features like ticket priority, attachments, or color-coded statuses

Integrate with Google Sheets or email alerts

Export to CSV or Excel

Whenever I ask you to update or extend the app, assume it’s referring to this codebase unless I say otherwise.

Let’s keep building something awesome 🚀

You can save that as a text block, a GitHub Gist, or even drop it at the top of your ticket_app.py file in a comment. Want help setting up a basic changelog or version tracker for your edits?

This doesn't feel thorough enough...
Totally fair—and I appreciate you wanting to do it right. Let’s flesh out a more complete, developer-friendly project brief you can share with me any time to bring me instantly back up to speed, whether it's next week or next year.

🧠 Streamlit Ticketing App – Project Brief for Copilot
Overview: You're helping me build a simple but powerful ticketing system using Streamlit in a single Python file (ticket_app.py). The app is designed for personal or small-team use and runs either locally or on Streamlit Community Cloud. It does not require a backend database or external hosting at this time.

✅ Current Features
1. Create Tickets

Inputs: title, category, due date (calendar), description

Tickets are stored as Python dictionaries in a list

Data is persisted to a file: tickets.json

2. Edit Tickets

All tickets are shown in a st.data_editor component (spreadsheet-style)

Users can directly modify any field (title, category, due date, description, status)

Changes are saved using a "Save Changes" button

3. Filter/Search

Sidebar filters:

Show/hide resolved tickets

Filter by category

Full-text search on title and description

Sort tickets by due date (optional)

4. File Storage

Ticket data is saved and loaded from tickets.json in the same directory

No external storage or cloud backend is configured yet

📁 Code Organization (All in one file for now)
load_tickets() – loads ticket data from JSON

save_tickets() – saves ticket list to JSON

Ticket creation form (inside a Streamlit st.form)

Filtering and search logic

Conversion of ticket list to pandas.DataFrame for editing

Display of editable tickets using st.data_editor()

Save button to commit edits back to file

🚀 Future Expansion Goals (Stuff I might want your help with next)
These are ideas I might ask for later. Keep this in mind when I say “Let’s add X”:

Allow deletion of tickets from the editor

Add priority labels (low, medium, high)

Display summary stats (e.g., open vs resolved count)

Export filtered tickets to CSV

Add basic user auth or password protection

Backup or sync data to Google Sheets or cloud storage

Add “Assigned To” field or tracking by user

Visual charts: ticket volume over time, by category, etc.

Form validation (e.g. block duplicate titles)

Option to group or collapse tickets by status, category, or due date

📌 Assumptions for You, Copilot:
Assume I’m working with one file: ticket_app.py

Assume I want the fewest possible dependencies (Python + Streamlit + pandas is fine)

I’ll let you know if I need this deployed or moved to a more scalable setup

Be opinionated: suggest structure, patterns, or improvements if the code starts to sprawl

If you need to refactor it into multiple files or bring in modular logic, I’m open to that too—just explain it clearly
